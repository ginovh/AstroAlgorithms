## VSOP87D code

VSOP87D code files are generated from original VSOP87 files and checked in. This avoids a dependency on the original VSOP87 files.

The files in this directory are generated by the Generate_VSOP87_code tool. 
A user of this astro algorithms library doesn't need to run this tool as the generated header files are checked in this directory.
The generation tool is only made available for reference.

These sources define L_xxx, B_xxx and R_xxx symbols that contain all the VSOP terms for a planet in a vector.
