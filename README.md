## Implementation of Astronomical Algorithms.

This is a very early version, just to backup my sources.
Goal is to implement all algorithms as described in the book "Astronomical Algorithms" from Jean Meeus.

**Usage:**

TBD

**Dependencies :**

- VSOP87 files are not checked in, so you need to download VSOP87 files separately to run VSOP87 tests. See also:

**To Build:**

- Open CMakeLists.txt file in QtCreator or build from command-line.
