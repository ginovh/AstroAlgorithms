## Implementation of Astronomical Algorithms.

This is a very early version, just to backup my sources.
Goal is to implement all algorithms as described in the book "Astronomical Algorithms" from Jean Meeus.
And use this library in y other astro repositories.

**Usage:**
TBD

**To Build:**
At this moment you need to download VSOP87 files seperately.
Open CMakeLists.txt file in QtCreator
